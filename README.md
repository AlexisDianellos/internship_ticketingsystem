Attica Internal IT Ticketing System

During my internship at Attica DPS, I noticed a recurring frustration: every day my coworkers were struggling with the company’s outdated system for managing IT tickets in EXCEL. Most requests were being tracked manually in Excel sheets, which led to inefficiencies, miscommunication, and delays in resolving technical issues.

After discussing these challenges with colleagues from SAP\ users to IT technicians in shops and in close collaboration with the company’s Head of IT

I designed and built a modern internal ticketing platform tailored to Attica’s unique needs.

Unlike other solutions, this system was customized for BI,SAP users, Store IT technitians, IT admins.

This personalization ensured that each department had a ticketing experience built around their daily workflow, rather than forcing everyone into a template.

The result was a platform that replaced the clunky Excel process with an efficient, scalable, and user-friendly system. Adoption spread company-wide during my internship, significantly improving IT support response times and making issue-tracking transparent across teams.

This project not only strengthened my technical skills in web application development but also gave me experience in requirements gathering, cross-department collaboration, and agile delivery in a real enterprise environment.
